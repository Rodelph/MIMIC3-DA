# Project Description

The aim of this project is to understand how real-life data from a healthcare system is acquired, stored, processed, visualized and used to provide meaningful insights for clinicians. For this purpose, a study on mortality prediction model of patients in ICU with heart failure disease is conducted. The data used in this study comes from the freely available MIMIC-III database. This database includes information of over forty thousand patients who stayed in the intensive care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.
